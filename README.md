# Brand Font Library
### Introduction
The Brand Font Library was set up for the r/sbubby community as a repository of information regarding the typefaces used by certain brands to make everyoneâ€™s life easier. I put in a few pieces of information into the library when I first set it up, but I encourage everyone to add more and expand the knowledge base. However, this repository is open to anyone who chooses to use it.

### Usage
To use the Brand Font Library, simply open the document labelled "Font Info" and search for the brand you require, and its corresponding info. Sometimes a URL will be provided to the download website for the typeface, but most of the time, a name will be provided which you can then search in a search engine of your choice.
>#### Tip:
