# Brand Font Library

### Please do not deface, damage, or in any way negatively edit this repository. It is here to provide information for r/sbubby creators and others who are interested in logoswapping or logo spoofing.

### Introduction
The Brand Font Library was set up for the r/sbubby community as a repository of information regarding the typefaces used by certain brands to make everyoneâ€™s life easier. I put in a few pieces of information into the library when I first set it up, but I encourage everyone to add more and expand the knowledge base. This repository is open to anyone who chooses to use it. If you like this project, consider donating using the badge at the top of the page.

### Usage
To use the Brand Font Library, simply open the document labelled "Font Info" and search for the brand you require, and its corresponding info. Sometimes a URL will be provided to the download website for the typeface, but most of the time, a name will be provided which you can then search in a search engine of your choice.  

### Match and Availability Guide
The term "Match" is used to describe how similar a typeface is to the original logo/brand. Due to the nature of this library, there is no option for "No" match as then that typeface wouldn't belong here.  
- Yes: The typeface is a near-perfect match and is almost indistinguishable from the original. May require some modifications for custom characters.  
- Partial: The typeface shares many identical features with the original. Characters may require some slight & simple editing to match the original, or you may have to swap some characters out for the originals.  
  
"Availability" is used to describe how easy it is to download a copy of the typeface in a usable format such as OpenType (.OTF) or TrueType (.TTF).  
- Free: The typeface is easily available for free on a trusted website such as Google Fonts.  
- Open Source: The typeface and its source files (such as other type formats or Vector formats) are freely available online.  
- Shady Website: The font is freely available from some less-than-reputable sites. It is not recommended you download things from these sites without very good computer protection. You can never be *too* careful.  
- Easier to Find Alternative: The typeface is very complicated to get your hands on but is still free. May require downloading from company website using Dev Tools (Firefox recommended for this, use "Fonts" tab) and the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/GameDesert/Brand-Font-Library/blob/main/README.md#extracting-a-typeface-from-a-website). As the name suggests, it is just easier to find a similar-looking alternative.  
- Account Restricted: Some websites require creating a Press account to access brand assets. I don't really know what you get, so you probably shouldn't bother.  

### Contribution
If you want to contribute your own fonts and information to the Brand Font Library, you need to generate a small paragraph using one of the formats provided. You will then need to append this paragraph onto the end of Font_Info.md to add it to the list. You can generate one of these info paragraphs by entering the font and brand details into the form at [kotla.eu/Brand-Font-Library/website](https://kotla.eu/Brand-Font-Library/website/index.html) or by writing it up manually using the format shown [here](https://github.com/GameDesert/Brand-Font-Library/blob/main/README.md#manual-entry).

### Disclaimer
I am absolutely not responsible for any damage, harm, or any negative effects that may come from using any of the information provided in this repository. This is an educational tool and all typefaces and brands belong to their respective holders.  

### Tips & Tricks
#### Manual Entry:
**Brand Name** | `In the format: **[Brand Name]** without the square brackets to make it bold.`  
Typeface Name | `In the format: [Typeface Name] without the square brackets.`  
Match: *Yes* | `In the format: Match: *Yes/Partial* to make it in italics.`  
Availability: *Free* | `In the format: Availability: *Free/Open Source/Shady Website/Easier to Find Alternative/Account Restricted* to make it in italics.`  
URL: *https://website.web* | `In the format: URL: *Website URL* to make it in italics.` **OPTIONAL**  
Notes: *text* | `In the format: Notes: *text* to make it in italics. You can use this field to add any notes about obtaining the typeface.` **OPTIONAL**
  
*Each line must be followed by 2 Spaces (`  `) to create a newline. Each section must be preceeded by a blank line, then 3 hyphens (`---`), and then another blank line to create a line rule.*  

#### Extracting a Typeface from a Website:
Firstly, open a web browser ([Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is recommended) and open the Devtools Inspector (`Q` on Firefox). Next, navigate to the `Fonts` panel and click `All Fonts On Page`. Find the font you are looking for, and click the copy button next to its URL. After that, paste the URL into your browser and download the provided file. Finally, use a website such as [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/) to convert the, (presumably) `.WOFF` file to a usable `.OTF` or `.TTF` file and just install it on your computer.
